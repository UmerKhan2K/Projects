#Snatch n Grab Inventory Management System
#Snatch n Grab is a small groceries store, which has been getting a lot of attention recently, and the
#owner has decided to expand his business.
#The owner has requested you to create an Inventory Management System for his store. This system
#will allow his employees to manage the store’s inventory, and should contain the following features:
#• Allow entry of new items
#• Categorize items into groups, such as dairy/produce/fruits/vegetables etc.
#• Allow entry of suppliers
#• Allow entry of shipments
#• Automatic request for restocking inventory
#The way the store operates, is that after a deal is made between the store and a supplier, the supplier is
#assigned certain items from the inventory. The supplier is then responsible for maintaining the stock
#of said items in the store. Previously, the employees had to manually request the suppliers to restock
#their items, but the owner wishes your application will be able to automate this process.
#Multiple suppliers send multiple shipments, which contain multiple items for the store. All this need
#to be organized and maintained.
#Once the items reach the store, they are placed in appropriate counters, where customers may pick
#them up and buy them. When a customer makes a purchase, the store records which item was sold and
#when, and if the item inventory reaches a certain threshold (can be different per item), a request for
#restock is generated.
#If a new item is provided to the store, it needs to be cataloged along with its category, and sub category,
#and then assigned to a supplier, and then finally confirm inventory size for the shop.
